# Getting Started

## What is DataKeep?

DataKeep is a module that loads and autosaves to datastores.

A Keep Datastore (Holds datastore saving information & methods) automatically saves itself and cleans up for you.

## Why DataKeep?

- No getter/setter functions, allows ability to write your own wrapper interface
- Session Locking, prevents other servers from editing directly to prevent duplication exploits or overwriting data loss
- GlobalUpdates to communicate to offline Keeps
- Similar API to previous data ModuleScript [ProfileService](https://github.com/MadStudioRoblox/ProfileService) allowing easy to pick up
- Promised base for control over exactly when things complete
- Actively maintained, and accepting contributions
